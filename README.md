# USPSInformationTracker

I want to make an application that will help me with my current job as a mail carrier for the United States Postal Service. Since the post office is 40 years behind and does almost everything by paper, I need to make sure that they are calculating my paycheck correctly. They never do. So far I have been keeping track of my hours and everything else about the job on paper.

- Every day I want to:

- Input the time that I clocked in

- Input the length of my lunch break, if I took one

- Input the route # for whatever route I delivered that day

- Input the truck # that I took

- Input whatever notes I had along that route, such as problematic addresses 

I want it to output:

- Hours worked on a given day

- Hours worked on a given week

- Hours worked on a given month

- Hours worked total

It should calculate my pay on a given day, week, month, while taking into account 

- Overtime pay
- Hazard pay
- Taxes

I walk around with a gps tracker to map my routes. I am still thinking about whether or not I should do something with this. I have a third-party app that creates a map for me already in my browser, maybe I can import that data into the program?

Program requirements:

After completing this, you will continue to develop your application in the following weeks. A peer review of your project will be required in Module 7, which you will need to turn in your application zip file and show your progress to your classmates. 

Please follow the following requirements for your final project, this shows a detailed breakdown for how the points are distributed:  

- A working GUI tkinter application with at least two windows.   50 points
  
- Implementing a modular approach in your application. 10 points
  
- Consistent clear navigation throughout the GUI application.   10 points

- Implement secure coding best practices, including input validation to check if the user entered the correct data type, make sure the entry box is not empty, etc.   10 points
  
- Validation testing - 20 points.  Develop an appropriate set of test data to fully validate the program against.


  - the data sets you tested against.
  - a brief written explanation of the results of your tests and what you had to fix.
